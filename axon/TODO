client has too many parameters to everything port, endpoint_prefix, ip_addr and name could be condensed into one parameter URL

to swap out the TL being tested, I'm not sure this is possible

implement socket TL
	There is an issue with the client transport layer taking a complete URL for an RPC invokation while the socket server does not have a concept of endpoints outside of its RPCs dict ~ just split the url along '/', take off the first three indices and rejoinwebsockets.sync.client.connect

	There is an issue with URLs containing transport-layer specific strings, like ws for websockets and http for HTTP.
