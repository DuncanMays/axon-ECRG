Move HTTPTranportWorker into a separate file - Transport_worker cannot import config information, or any file that imports config, since it is imported by the config file, and so there would be a circular reference

write tests for HTTPTRansportWorker and HTTPTransportClient
	register an RPC with register_RPC
	then call it with call_RPC
- transport tests calls RPCs registered in __init__ with call_RPC, this isn't ideal but it's passable for now

Change get_profile to only serve profiles for the requesting tl
test with multiple instances of HTTPTranportWorker
	Create RemoteWorker objects with different transport layers and test to see that they're different
