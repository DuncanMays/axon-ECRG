Should look into a good way to manuallly specify which TL is under test. This might not be possible in pytest, but maybe if we put the tests with the module on Pypi we can have a python -m command to run the transport layer tests on another python module representing a transport layer.

implement socket TL

	There is an issue with URLs containing transport-layer specific strings, like ws for websockets and http for HTTP. This is blocking transport tests, since a lot of times the prefix on the URl is hardcoded and so can't be swapped during the test for different transport layers.

	client has too many parameters to everything port, endpoint_prefix, ip_addr and name could be condensed into one parameter URL

	Don't forget to involve executors in the socket transport client, and rename worker_tests to something more fitting, maybe concurrency_tests

Change client calls to use URLs

	use service_client_test to verify progress

	Change stubs to use URLs

	Change metaStubs to use URLs
